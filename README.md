# Ache uma FarmÃ¡cia Popular

The "FarmÃ¡cia Popular" Program of Brazil government has a page with accredited
pharmacies, but it is being posted in [xlsx
format](https://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/composicao/sectics/farmacia-popular/arquivos/farmacias_credenciadas_pfpb_atualizada.xlsx/view),
which is a proprietary format. I want to create a website to allow people to
filter pharmacies closest to their residence.

## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm an experienced software developer passionate about empowering individuals
and crafting exceptional code. With a solid background since 2010, I have honed
my Java, Kotlin, Python, and Go skills while delving into Node and Lua
programming languages. Alongside my Master's degree in Software Engineering, I
have achieved significant milestones as a Tech Leader and currently as a Staff
Engineer. My greatest accomplishment lies in nurturing the growth of
individuals, valuing their development as much as the software itself.
